# ETS-Openstudio-Measure
The following repository contains an Openstudio measure for the modelling of the thermal performance and controls of a central electric thermal storage (ETS) device, as part of a whole building energy simulation in EnergyPlus. Please refer to the "Instructions_Openstudio" file for further details. 

This work has been developped as part of a graduate research project at the École de technologie supérieure (ÉTS) of Montréal - Laboratory of Thermal and Building Science (LTSB) and Hydro-Québec's Laboratoire des technologies de l'énergie (LTE).

Developer : Houssem Eddine Younes, Msc (ÉTS)

Research supervisors: Katherine D'Avignon, PhD (ÉTS) and François Laurencelle, PhD (HQ-LTE)
